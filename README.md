# ðŸŽ“ Educational AI Agent System

This project demonstrates a multi-agent educational platform built using the **Fetch.ai `uAgents` framework**. It features a modular architecture with a Student, Tutor, and Knowledge agent. A key feature is the AI Assessment agent, which leverages **Google's Gemini AI** to provide personalized learning recommendations. The system also uses the SingularityNET **`MeTTa` knowledge graph** for structured curriculum retrieval and the **Chat Protocol** for user interaction, ensuring compatibility with the ASI:One interface.

### Project Overview

| Agent Name | Role | Technology Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Student Agent** | **User Interface (CLI):** Handles session initiation, user input (subject/level choices, answers, AI diagnostics), and displays the Tutor's questions and feedback. | `uagents`, `Chat Protocol` |
| **Tutor Agent** | **Central Coordinator:** Manages the user's session state (history), routes queries to the Knowledge Agent, grades answers, and forwards diagnostic requests to the AI Assessment Agent. | `uAgents`, `Chat Protocol`, State Management |
| **Knowledge Agent** | **Knowledge Base:** Serves questions and answers based on specific Subject/Level queries by querying the structured `curriculum.metta` file using `MeTTa`. | `uAgents`, `MeTTa` (`hyperon`), Knowledge Graph |
| **AI Assessment Agent** | **(Optional) AI Diagnostician:** Receives user challenges from the Tutor, analyzes them, and provides a personalized subject/level recommendation. | `uAgents`, AI Integration (Google Gemini) |

### Required Submission Badges

The agents are categorized under Innovation Lab and are part of the Hackathon:

### Setup and Running Instructions

This guide assumes you have **Python 3.9+** and have initialized a virtual environment (`venv`).

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayomideadeniran/edu-agent-platform
cd edu-agent-platform/src 
```

**2. Install Dependencies**

This project requires `uagents` for agent communication and `hyperon` for MeTTa integration:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Agent Addresses**

The three agents communicate using pre-determined addresses, which are written to local files on startup. Please ensure the following files exist in the `src` directory with the most recently generated addresses:

  * **Tutor Agent Address:** `tutor_address.txt`
  * **Knowledge Agent Address:** `knowledge_address.txt`
  * **Student Agent Address:** `student_address.txt`

For the judges' reference, the expected addresses for the agents are:

  * **Tutor Agent:** `agent1qfz0z6wc0ep8ser24qssdf3dtkln4lyzvvutr0zwj0kv0h74w6r8yhe7kyt`
  * **Knowledge Agent:** `agent1q0n0gf3nm2mevkj6mm45cmjvm3sx23glx38sdmn4kjmw8xm4stn2q600dnq`
  * **Student Agent:** `agent1qddgfypwrksthknutu7pxxk4mkp86uma7g0lrxp8ae3wdx472qjxyxhzgp5`

**4. Run Agents (In Order)**

Run each agent in a separate terminal window, ensuring the `venv` is activated for all sessions:

| Terminal | Command | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Terminal 1** | `python knowledge_agent.py` | Starts the MeTTa knowledge base. |
| **Terminal 2** | `python ai_assessment_agent.py` | (Optional) Starts the AI diagnostician. |
| **Terminal 3** | `python tutor_agent.py` | Starts the central coordinator. |
| **Terminal 4** | `python student_agent.py` | Starts the user interface (CLI). |


**5. Interaction**

Once all three agents are running, interact with the platform via **Terminal 3** (`student_agent.py`). Follow the menu prompts to:

1.  Select a subject (Math, History, Science).
2.  Select a difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate).
3.  Answer the question.
4.  Use the `[0] Check My History` option to view the Tutor Agent's grading and session history.

### Use of ASI Alliance Technology

| Technology | Implementation in Project |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`uAgents` Framework** | Forms the foundation of the entire architecture. Used for all inter-agent communication, agent state management, and defining clear protocols. |
| **`MeTTa` Knowledge Graph** | Integrated into the `knowledge_agent.py` to query the `curriculum.metta` file. We use a robust `(question ...)` fact structure for reliable, subject/level-based retrieval. |
| **Chat Protocol** | Implemented in the `student_agent.py` and `tutor_agent.py` to handle all user interactions, ensuring the application is compatible with the Agentverse and ASI:One interface for seamless human-agent interaction. |

## 1. Creating the Virtual Environment (One-Time Setup)

You typically do this step only once per project.

1.  **Navigate** to your project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ~/Documents/Project/ASI-Agents-Track/edu-agent-platform/src
    ```
2.  **Create the environment:** This command tells Python to create a virtual environment named `venv` inside your current directory.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
      * *Note: If you are on an older system, you might need to use `python3` instead of `python`.*

---

## 2. Activating the Virtual Environment

You must do this step **every time** you open a new terminal session for your project.

To activate the environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### How to Confirm Activation

After running the command above, your terminal prompt will change to show the name of the environment in parentheses. In your case, it will look like this:

```bash
(venv) knights@knights-VivoBook-ASUSLaptop-X420UA:~/Documents/Project/ASI-Agents-Track/edu-agent-platform/src$
```

### Why Use `venv`?

A virtual environment ensures that the Python packages you install for your project (like `uagents` and `hyperon`) are isolated from the rest of your system's Python packages. This prevents conflicts and keeps your project dependencies clean.

---

## 3. Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you are finished working on this project in your current terminal window, you can exit the virtual environment using the command:

```bash
deactivate
```

Your terminal prompt will return to its normal state, and any subsequent `pip install` commands will affect your global Python environment (which is usually what you want to avoid).
